                <p>I love designing experiences, especially if they are 
                   supported by physical products. When designing, I like to consider 
                   how my designs may complement the larger system. I believe in 
                   user-centered design and user testing + research so I make
                   it a large part of my design process.
                </p>

                  Besides design, I enjoy exploring new skills such as programming, 
                  illustration, photography, and baking. I am interested in technology and 
                  am persuing a minor in Computer Science.
